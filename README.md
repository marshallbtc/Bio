The below repos are listed and linked in reverse-chronological order of when I completed the class or project.

# CSCI 326 – Cloud Computing
#### https://github.com/marshallbtc/CSCI-326
In this course, I was introduced to Cloud Computing with a focus on implementing programs on distributed computers and delivering them as a service. We explored diverse aspects of this broad area, ranging from the design of cloud systems to creating applications on cloud systems. Selected topics included the theory of distributed systems, the benefits and challenges of the cloud, MapReduce and Spark, algorithm design on distributed systems, Amazon Web Services, and data analysis.


# CSCI 397A – Software Tools
#### https://github.com/marshallbtc/CSCI-397A
A deep dive into the study of software tools and environments commonly used throughout the software life cycle and beyond. The course focus was on the tools used in the software life cycle, the goals of each tool, how the tools are used in practice, and the technology behind the tools. I learned how to choose from among a variety of different tools for a given software engineering task. Tools included integrated development environments, software testing and debugging, build tools, static analysis, performance profiling, and containers. In addition, we learned Unix commands, bash scripting, and how to interact with software tools from the command line.


# CSCI 209 – Software Development
#### https://github.com/marshallbtc/CSCI-209
An examination of the theories and design techniques used in software development. Topics include the software life cycle, design patterns, the Unified Modeling Language, unit testing, refactoring, rapid prototyping, and program documentation.


# CSCI 210 – Computer Organization
#### https://github.com/marshallbtc/CSCI-210
Multilevel machine organization studied at the levels of digital logic, microprogramming, conventional machine, operating system, and assembly language.


# CSCI 112 – Fundamentals of Programming II
#### https://github.com/marshallbtc/CSCI-112
A continuation of CSCI 111. Emphasis is on the use and implementation of data structures, introductory algorithm analysis, and object-oriented design and programming with Python. Laboratory course.


# EDGAR SEC Web Scraper and Simple Analysis
#### https://github.com/marshallbtc/SEC_EDGAR_WebScraper
My first independent python project. I felt inspired to write this during the Covid-19 lockdown in May 2020 after completing my first computer science course, CSCI 111. 


# CSCI 111 – Fundamentals of Programming I
#### https://github.com/marshallbtc/CSCI-111
A disciplined approach to programming with Python. Emphasis is on problem-solving methods, algorithm development, and object-oriented concepts. Lectures and formal laboratories.
